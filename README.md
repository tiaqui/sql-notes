# SQL notes

### Welcome to my repository ! 

In it you will find ... well, you won't find much, but a PDF file containing notes on general SQL queries, statements, functions and other relevant information.

These notes were created based on the content of the following courses:

<ul>
	<li> Complete SQL Bootcamp, Udemy.
	<li> SQL for Data Analysis, Udacity.
</ul>

Both courses are centered in <i><b>PostgreSQL</b></i>, but most of its contents are useful for any SQL engine.
